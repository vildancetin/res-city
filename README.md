# Travel Planner

This project revolves around travel planning. Upon clicking a city image, a modal page opens, allowing you to input relevant information. The other section encompasses cities that have been visited or are currently being visited. By double-clicking on a city, its status changes to "visited," implemented using the ondoubleclick event. 
Additionally, clicking the cancel option removes the item both from the Document Object Model (DOM) and local storage. All data originates from local storage, ensuring that every modification is saved locally.
